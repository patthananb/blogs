            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div class="markdown-body">
                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>I was born Patthanan Bean Bhandhumanee on September 28, 2001, in Saraburi, Thailand, and grew up in Trang. Three years after I was born, I have a sister named Bam. My grandmother and my mom raised me up in Trang.</p>
                
                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I studied kindergarten and elementary school at Buranalumuk School. When I turned 15, I moved to Bangkok to study for my Vocational Certificate degree in Electrical Technician at King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok (KMUTNB). After that, I continued studying at the same university for my Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering. I didn't do well in university and took 6 years to finish my degree.</p>
                
                <p>During my university years, I felt disoriented by the people who taught me—some were good, some were bad. I spent my 6 years mostly studying for myself. I am using this space to praise the good teachers that I admire in my life.</p>
                
                <h2>Teachers Who Inspired Me</h2>
                
                <h3>Dr.Ing. Rawat Siripokapirom</h3>
                <p>He is the one who inspired me to create this blog. He taught me so many things: embedded systems, electrical circuits, signal and systems, and especially computer programming and computer stuff. I am a dude with plenty of curiosity in my pocket, and when I try to build something, he will have the components for me every time and he gives them without hesitation—how generous is he? Some have said, "If you talked to him today, he may not know or understand, and if you come see him tomorrow, he will be an expert in that field."</p>
                
                <h3>Dr. Bunlung Neammanee & Dr. Jirawut Benjanarasut</h3>
                <p>I pack these two professors in a pair because when I see one of them, I will see the other one too. When I get stuck in anything, they have always been there for me to help me figure out what to do next. Dr. Bunlung is good at life advising—he always asks me questions that pull myself to think.</p>
